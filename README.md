Hi, I'm @fr-math.
I'm interested in math, programming and related stuff.
I'm currently learning programming (python right now) and doing a math's degree.
I'm looking to develop myself to an acceptable level on math and programming, and to learn machine learning in order to study the matemathical aspect of this, and satisfy my curiosity. The rest will come with time.
If you wanna get in touch, my e-mail address is francorimoli@yahoo.com.ar for yahoo and f.r.sinapsis@gmail.com for gmail. 
Thanks for passing by here. Enjoy and have a good day. All your suggestions are welcome.
